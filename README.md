# Analysis of Meteorological features and Prediction of Rainfall in Australia
This report is a course project on the analysis of meteorological features and prediction of rainfall in Australia, using the Rain in Australia dataset. The report includes the following sections:
 - **Dataset Overview**: This section describes the attributes of the dataset, the number of observations, and the data types.
 - **Data Preprocessing**: This section carries out data exploration, data cleaning, data reduction, and statistical testing steps. Methods such as the 3-sigma rule, PCA, MCA, Z-test, and Chi-squared test are used.
 - **Research Data Analysis**: This section performs univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, time series analysis, cluster data analysis, and the FP-Growth problem. Methods such as Univariate Analysis, Multivariate Analysis, Cross-Tabulate, FP-Growth, and specific types of charts are used.
 - **Conclusion**: This section summarizes the research results, evaluates the strengths and weaknesses, and proposes future development directions.
